## Class 6 - Midterm presentation

Making an app is a lot more than knowing how to code, it's about having a clear idea about what you want to achieve, and figuring out the most effective way of getting there.

For the remaineder of this class you are going to work primarily on your own projects, and I will support and coach you in the process of conceptualizing and building your app.

The midterm presentation should be in the format of    
1. a pitch deck   
2. a prototype



## The Pitch Deck
There is no universal right way to put together a pitch deck, because each one will depend on the concept you are presenting. In the real world though, pitch decks are extremely valuable documents, since they help people raise money for their ideas. Since we are focusing on coding and designing apps, you don't need to delve too deeply into real-world business problems (such as customers, profits etc), but you are free to use your imagination if you want to make up numbers if you feel like it. Since this is a class presentation, and not a Shark Den moment, your Pitch deck will be a little different, with more details on the app mechanics and less on the rationale.

The Pitch deck should at least cover these areas:

- The Problem
- The Solution
- Look and feel
- UX wireframes
- Technology



### The Problem
Describe the problem you are solving. This can be a real problem, eg. "The average American teenager throws away x tonnes of almost unused clothes each year", or an imaginary problem, eg. "The Lilliputians are constantly overlooked". You can use pictures, words, graphs or quotes etc to illustrate the point.

### The Solution
How will you solve it? This is where you will impress us with how your app is going to solve the problem. If you have a genius idea you think can actually solve a real world problem, go for it, but if you can't think of anything, it's also ok to copy something that is already out there. You have to make your own version of it though.


### Look and feel
The look and feel will depend on what kind of app you are planning to build. A financial app will look very different from a fashion app, and the amount of design work needed will depend on the concept. Typically companies use something called a [moodboard](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&len=2&q=moodboard&eq=moodb&etslf=3374&term_meta[]=moodboard%7Cautocomplete%7C0) to communicate a design aesthetic that may not be fully elaborated yet. 

Since this is an app pitch deck some mock up designs of important screens are expected though.

### UX wireframes
You should have a fully fledged wireframe of all the needed pages/screens in your app. You don't necessarily need to present this in the form of the prototype, it can be through wireframe diagrams included in the Pitch deck.

### Technology
This section should be more detailed than what you would expect from a normal Pitch deck. Here I want to see explorations of different code frameworks out there that you have explored, the pros and cons of each, and the reason you plan to use the technology you have chosen. The aim here is for you to explore what is available, even if we have not talked about it in class. 

Ultimately, the goal is to learn how to learn, and for a mobile app developer that means being able to read and understand documentation, and test other people's frameworks or npm packages.


## The Prototype
This is a coding class, so it's not enough to just make pretty pictures. A protoype is a proof-of-concept, with some of the core functionality in place. What part of your final project should be in this early prototype depends on your concept, but a good place to start is to create the `navigation` and the `screens` to give a sense of how the final app would work. 

Also, feel free to present several prototypes, where you perhaps explore one of the possible frameworks above in each. It is often good coding practice to break down large problems into smaller pieces. 

*The prototype(s) should be submitted in the form of a public git repo that should build locally without errors.*

## Other considerations
I also want you to consider:   
* Where do you think your biggest challenge/learning will be?   
* How long do you think the project will take? Can you do all of it in time, or should you focus on a part?

There is right answer to how a pitch deck should look, or what it must contain. It will depend on your concept.
